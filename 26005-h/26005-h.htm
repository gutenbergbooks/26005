<h2>The Garden in October</h2>

<p>October is a fine time to plant every kind of "bulb, root and tuber,"
also all deciduous plants and shrubs, except those with thin bark or
thick, fleshy roots (e.g., birch magnolia).</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Clean up and burn diseased plants, manure the garden, plow it and leave
it all winter.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Burn asparagus tops and manure the bed. Also make new asparagus and
rhubarb beds and plant sets of extra early pearl onions for use next
March. Put some parsley plants in a box and place it in a light cellar
or in a shed.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Put some frozen rhubarb roots in a barrel of earth in the cellar where
they will produce "pie-plant," for winter use. Dig chickory for salad
and store in sand in a dry cellar. Blanch endive by tying lightly at the
tips.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Pull up cabbages, leaving roots on, and stand upside down on shelf in
cellar. Pick cranberries this month. Then cover the bog with a foot of
water to drown bugs and to protect from frost. Rake up the fallen leaves
and use as a mulch for flowers and shrubs. Hardwood leaves like oak and
chestnut contain more plant food than those from soft wooded
trees.&mdash;<i>Garden and Farm Almanac. Doubleday, Page and Company.</i></p>


<h2>Every Morning</h2>

<h3>A Little Crystal of Thought for Every Day in the Week</h3>


<div class="blockquot"><h4>SUNDAY.</h4>

<p>Most of us could manage to be fairly happy if we really
tried to make the best of things.</p>


<h4>MONDAY.</h4>

<p><i>Don't get depressed even if things do seem to be going
wrong at the moment. Depression will make matters worse
rather than better. If you do your duty faithfully, the sun
is sure to shine again sometime.</i></p>


<h4>TUESDAY.</h4>

<p>Many people pride themselves on their plain speaking. An
ability to put things pleasantly is really far more
valuable. Even fault-finding can be pleasantly done.</p>


<h4>WEDNESDAY.</h4>

<p><i>It always seems to me that God is probably less anxious
that we should fulfil our tasks in life than that we should
do our best.</i></p>


<h4>THURSDAY.</h4>

<p>Of the people who complain most bitterly that they have "no
chance" probably a very small proportion would do great
things if great opportunities came. "No chance" is a very
old excuse.</p>


<h4>FRIDAY.</h4>

<p><i>Don't give way to selfishness&mdash;that detestable vice that we
all find it so difficult to forgive in others.</i></p>


<h4>SATURDAY.</h4>

<p>Even if you don't like your work, try to do it well. It may
lead on to your true vocation.</p></div>


<h2>For the Automobile Visitor</h2>

<p>It is the frequent experience of the housewife living in the country or
suburbs these days to receive unexpected visits from friends who are
touring in automobiles, and she finds she must have something
attractive, dainty and nourishing ready at a moment's notice to
supplement the cup of tea or coffee so welcome after a hot, dusty trip.
It is a wise plan to keep a variety of Summer Sausage on hand, as in a
very few minutes delicious sandwiches may be prepared with this, these
sandwiches having the charm of novelty. It is impossible to deal in a
short article with the many varieties of Summer Sausage, but there are
three or four which can be touched upon. To have a thorough
understanding of their goodness one must not only read about them but
taste them. They are the staple diet in many foreign countries and in
the Armour brand the native flavoring has been done with remarkable
faithfulness&mdash;so much so that large quantities are shipped from this
country every week to the countries where they originated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cervelat</span>: This sausage is made of finest pork chopped fine, smoked and
air dried. It is highly spiced. A very delicious way to serve this is to
cut thin slices of white bread in rounds just the size of the sausage.
Put the meat, cut very thin, between the slices of bread and toast for a
minute with a very hot fire. This keeps the exposed sides absolutely dry
and the sandwich can be eaten without a fork.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">German Salami</span>: This sausage will be much appreciated by people who like
the smoky flavor of ham and bacon. In it the meat is chopped a little
coarser than in the Cervelat, and the spicing is the same as that used
in Germany. Serve cut very thin, with rye or bran bread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lackschinken</span>: This is a very delicately flavored German titbit. It is
made of boneless pork loins cured in mild sweet pickle before smoking.
It makes delicious sandwiches with white or brown bread sliced thin and
lightly buttered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mortadella</span>, a favorite Italian sausage, is made from lean pork ham meat
chopped very fine. The flavoring is delicious, the careful blending of
spices giving a distinctly foreign touch.</p>

<p>In many restaurants throughout the country they serve, as in foreign
countries, a slice or two of Summer Sausage as an appetizer before
beginning the meal. This custom is rapidly spreading into the home, and
Summer Sausage now has an established place in the daily bill of fare.</p>

<p>In Germany the government maintains a system of education in what is
called intensive farming. Through instructors who go about the country,
the farmers are taught how to get a bigger yield from the same area of
soil. The work of these wonderful teachers is supplemented by women
domestic science teachers who in the same manner visit the homes in
their districts and instruct the good <i>Haus Frau</i> on how to improve,
economize, and systematize in kitchen and household work.</p>

<p>The manner in which these women instruct is, I am sure, of especial
interest to the Cook Book readers, inasmuch as the method is in a way
practically the same as what the Cook Book is doing. Where they teach by
hand and mouth the Cook Book has taught through its exchange of ideas,
contest stories, and recipe contests, the object being the same in both
cases that of instruction, education and economy in the kitchen and
saving of steps in the housework.</p>

<p>It is truly said of Germans that they are the most frugal and economical
of all people. In the past the usual method has been to exert this
frugality with what is already on hand in the larder left-overs, so to
speak. One point of the modern instruction of these wandering domestic
science teachers, as they go from home to home, is to show the economy
of systematic buying of groceries, meats and vegetables. Where the
practice in the past has been to buy a little, so there is not much
expenditure of money, German housewives are now taught the economy of
buying in bulk, because it is cheaper, and there is never any waste of
food in a German home, no matter how much of it there may be on hand.</p>

<p>Neither is there any good reason why there should be any waste of food
in an American home. Economy or frugality comes from knowing how, and
not from any stingy purpose, as some ill-advised people think.</p>

<p>The methods of these teachers show that this wonderful nation is alive
to the fact that the high cost of living is in our own waste and
carelessness, that oftentimes we do not make the most of what we have or
what we are given to do with.</p>

<h2>The Subject of Desserts</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 152px;">
<img src="images/fig4b.jpg" width="152" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Although a meal satisfies your hunger you should have dessert, because
the educated palate craves that particular spice as a proper finish.
Scientists tell us that a dinner digests better because of a tasty
dessert, which, they say, gives the final stimulus necessary to dispose
of the food previously received.</p>

<p>The simple desserts are the best desserts, and none is more pleasing to
the eye and the palate or so easily made or so frequently served in an
imperfect manner, than custards.</p>

<p>With a supply of good eggs in the pantry the housewife need never be at
a loss for a tasty custard, and if she is wise enough to buy Armour's
Fancy Selects when she orders eggs from her market man their goodness
will be reflected in her desserts. Aside from their goodness their extra
large size will always recommend their use to the wise housewife. They
come packed in an extra large carton.</p>


<h4>Custard Puddings</h4>

<p>These being the more easily made may be considered first. They may
either be steamed or baked but the mixture is the same in either case.
Allow two eggs and a teaspoonful of sugar to each half pint of milk.
Beat the eggs with sugar thoroughly, but do not froth them, as the
custard must be as smooth and free from holes as possible. Add the milk
slowly, also a few drops of flavoring essence&mdash;vanilla, almonds or
lemon. Pour into a buttered mould (or into individual moulds), set in a
pan of hot water and bake until firm. Chill thoroughly and turn out on
serving dish. Serve with sugar and cream. A pleasing addition to the
above is made by garnishing the sides of the mould with strips of Canton
ginger before pouring in the custard.</p>


<h4>Coffee Custard</h4>

<p>Make an infusion of coffee by pouring half a pint of boiling milk on a
heaping tablespoonful of powdered coffee. Put it aside to settle, and
when cold strain off the milk and use with the eggs as in previous
recipe.</p>

<h4>Boiled Custard</h4>

<p>This is also made from milk and eggs and is usually served instead of
cream with stewed or preserved fruit. "Boiled" custard is rather a
misnomer as on no account must the boiling point be reached in cooking,
for if the custard bubbles it curdles. As soon as the custard begins to
thicken the saucepan must be taken from the fire and the stirring
continued for a second or two longer. If the cooking is done in a double
boiler the risk of boiling is very much lessened.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Everyday Uses of Armour's Grape Juice</h2>

<p>Give your family Armour's Grape Juice as an everyday beverage and their
bodies will be kept healthy without drugs.</p>

<p>Instead of serving fruit in the morning serve a wineglassful of Armour's
Grape Juice undiluted. If taken at the beginning of breakfast do not add
ice. For children, water may be added if desired.</p>

<p>In moistening mincemeat use Armour's Grape Juice instead of jelly or
wine. In making "Brown Betty" use Armour's Grape Juice instead of water
and molasses and you will find it richer and more delicious.</p>

<p>In making sauce for all kinds of fruit puddings, use Armour's Grape
Juice, hot or cold, thickened when necessary with a little cornstarch.</p>

<p>When making fruit salad to be served as a dessert, pour over the mixed
fruits, immediately before serving, a cup of Armour's Grape Juice.</p>

<p>In serving grape fruit, after carefully removing the white pith, pour
over each portion a wineglassful of Armour's Grape Juice.</p>

<p>Many people find it difficult to take raw eggs when recommended by their
doctor. This difficulty is removed by breaking the egg into a glass of
Armour's Grape Juice. The egg is swallowed easily and in addition to the
nourishment obtained there is the tonic value of the rich fruit from
which the grape juice is taken.</p>

<h3>To Bleach White Silk</h3>

<p>When either white silk fabric or embroidery has become yellowed from
careless washing, it may be bleached in the following manner:</p>

<p>Dissolve two ounces each of salt and oxalic acid in six quarts of cold
water.</p>

<p>Soak the silk in this until the yellow tinge disappears. This will take
about an hour in ordinary cases.</p>

<p>Rinse immediately in several clear waters.</p>

<h2>Informal Porch Suppers</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 146px;">
<img src="images/fig5b.jpg" width="146" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>If you are fortunate enough to possess a wide porch or a stretch of lawn
do not forget your less fortunate friends, and give an occasional
informal party there while the weather is still fine. Food always tastes
so much better in the fresh air and when friends are present it makes
the affair nothing more than a kind of glorified picnic. There are few
more pleasant ways of entertaining than by giving a porch party. It is
very little trouble to arrange an affair of this kind&mdash;less than the
average picnic indeed&mdash;and grown people usually enjoy it more as it is
much more comfortable to sit in a chair before a real table than to
perch on a log or rock while eating. A porch party is an ideal way of
entertaining for the woman who has to do her own work. Most of the
dishes can be prepared the day before, making the serving easier.</p>

<p>If not convenient to have a large table a number of small card tables
placed close together will answer the purpose. Charming table sets of
white crepe paper can be bought for very little and save very materially
in the doing up of the linen.</p>

<p>Prepare as much as possible early in the day. If you have sandwiches
wrap them in a damp napkin; if cold drinks are wanted have them well
chilled, your glasses and straws handy, have your silver and china ready
at hand so that when your guests arrive you may devote your time and
attention to them. The following menus are not hard to prepare and the
dishes will be found most palatable and suited to every purse: Veribest
Canned Meats, the standby of the housewife who combines economy of time
with excellence of quality, are used in many of them. There is a wide
range of these meats delicious and many ways of using them. Every pantry
should have at least one shelf devoted to them so that the housewife
need never be at a loss for the basis of a good meal.</p>

<h4>Ham Mouss&eacute;</h4>

<p>One tablespoonful granulated gelatine, one half cup hot water, one can
Veribest Deviled Ham, teaspoonful mustard (mixed), one half cup rich
cream.</p>

<p>Dissolve the gelatine in the hot water, and add to the ham; season with
the mustard, add the cream beaten stiff and pour into a mould which has
been previously wet with cold water. Chill. Turn out to serve and
garnish with parsley.</p>


<h4>Creamed Chicken</h4>

<p>Make a plain white sauce of one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful
flour and one cup of milk with seasoning of salt and pepper. When this
is ready add the contents of a can of Veribest Boned Chicken, gently
pulling apart the flakes of meat with a fork. When thoroughly heated
serve in a roll which has been hollowed out for the purpose, with a
garnish of cooked asparagus stalks.</p>


<h4>Tongue Toast</h4>

<p>Remove the contents of a can of Veribest Lunch Tongue and cut in dice.
Add a little cream and the beaten yolk of one egg. Simmer for a few
minutes and serve on squares of toast.</p>


<h4>Potatoes au Gratin</h4>

<p>Dice enough cold boiled potatoes to measure one pint. Put one
tablespoonful of butter and the same amount of flour in a saucepan with
a little salt and pepper. Cook till well mixed, then add one cupful of
milk and stir until smooth and thick. Add the potatoes and simmer five
minutes, then pour into a buttered, shallow baking dish. Mix one scant
cupful of fine, dry bread crumbs with one tablespoonful of melted
butter, spread over the potatoes and place in a hot oven until the
crumbs are a golden brown, then serve hot.</p>


<h4>Marshmallow Pudding</h4>

<p>Make a plain lemon jelly, adding a little sherry wine if desired. Put a
layer of sliced marshmallows in the bottom of the mold, and when the
jelly has begun to set spread a little of it over them. Continue with
jelly and marshmallows till the mold is full, then put away to harden.
Serve with whipped cream.</p>


<h4>A Dainty Dessert</h4>

<p>Lemon and grape juice frapp&eacute; is another cool dessert that is also light.
To make it, boil a pint of water with two cupfuls of granulated sugar
for ten minutes and cool it. Then add a little cinnamon and half a
cupful of lemon juice, and lastly a quart of Armour's grape juice.
Freeze and serve in cups, with a little of the grape juice.</p>

<h3>Shelving Responsibility</h3>

<p>"I'll ask my husband."</p>

<p>"I don't think my husband would allow me to do that."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Jack would say 'No.'"</p>

<p>Do you know the wife who, whenever she does not want to do anything,
always places the responsibility on her husband's shoulders?</p>

<p>She knows quite well that she can do almost anything she likes with her
husband, and that there are really precious few things that he <i>would</i>
say "No" to her doing, but she finds that to say her husband would never
allow her to do this, or that, is a very easy way of saying "No" to
people without offending them.</p>

<p>But it's not quite fair on the husband really, because, after a time,
people begin to think that he really must be rather a bear to be so
strict with his wife.</p>

<p>And he gets disliked, very often, accordingly.</p>

<p>If you don't want to do a thing, <i>say</i> so; don't make your husband the
scapegoat.</p>

<p>Of course the wife who does this kind of thing never dreams that people
will blame her husband: it's just a convenient fiction to her.</p>

<p>But people are apt to think less of her husband because of it.</p>

<p>So you'll be wise to find some other excuse when excuses are
necessary.&mdash;<i>Exchange.</i></p>

<h2>A Necessity in the Pantry</h2>


<p>"How can you get along without a ham in the house?" asked one housewife
of another; "to me it is as necessary as anything we ever have in our
pantry."</p>

<p>This housewife, in saying the above, echoed the sentiments of many
others. There is no meat more "necessary" in the house than good ham.
Not only is the meat there in all its nutriment but it is
preserved&mdash;that is, cured and smoked&mdash;in such a way that there is given
to it a piquancy which whets the appetite and gives a stimulus to the
gastric juices, thus aiding&mdash;so the doctors tell us&mdash;the process of
digestion.</p>

<p>In so many cases of convalescence where the appetite is flagging and the
digestion weak, ham and bacon are prescribed, both for their tonic and
nutritive value.</p>

<p>On the crisp snappy mornings of autumn when a hearty breakfast is
necessary and the appetite has not yet recovered from the jading effects
of the hot weather what could be more tempting and more nourishing than
a slice of broiled ham&mdash;broiled just enough to be thoroughly cooked and
yet not enough to discolor the delicious appetising pink color of the
meat. Even the aroma thrown out in the process of cooking sends a
tempting appeal to the stomach that is impossible to resist.</p>

<p>Buying a whole ham at a time is the best and most economical way of
buying ham, as experience will prove. It can be boiled or baked whole
and sliced for whatever purpose intended. When baked ham is broiled for
breakfast it requires to be cooked just long enough to get hot all the
way through.</p>

<p>It is many years since the curing of ham was first tried and in those
years much has been accomplished. Today Armour's Star Hams represent
perfection in cured ham. In them the highest quality is allied to
skillful curing and careful smoking.</p>

<p>From many thousand hams those intended for the Star brand are chosen;
the process of curing is a specialty of Armour and Company, and careful
smoking over green hickory logs gives the final necessary touch.</p>

<p>They say "the proof of the pudding is the tasting of it" and this
applies to Armour's Star Hams as well.</p>

<p>[Many ways of using this, to most people, necessary meat, will be found
on page 12.]</p>

<h2>Halloween Hints</h2>


<h4>Witch Apples</h4>

<p>Bake large apples from which the core has been removed until soft, but
not long enough to burst the skin. When cooked, insert a marshmallow
into the core space, put a teaspoonful of sugar on top and a few
maraschino cherries. When ready to serve turn over each a scant
teaspoonful of brandy and light just as the table is reached. The brandy
will burn with a ghastly flame and melt the sugar and marshmallows.
Whipped cream served in a bowl is a delicious addition.</p>


<h4>Witch Cake</h4>

<p>Cream one half cupful of butter with one and one half cupfuls of sugar;
add three eggs and beat five minutes; add one cupful of milk. Sift
together one third cupful of cornstarch, and two cupfuls of flour, one
and one half teaspoonfuls of ground mixed spices, and three teaspoonfuls
of baking powder; then add to the mixture. Now add one cupful of seeded
floured raisins, also one cupful of chopped nuts. Turn into a well
greased loaf cake pan and bake in a moderate oven about forty-five
minutes. Frost with a white boiled icing. Melt sweet chocolate to equal
one third cupful, flavor with a teaspoonful of lemon juice, add one
cupful of boiled chestnuts which have been run through the meat grinder,
and enough confectionery sugar to make a paste easily handled. Roll and
cut (by pasteboard pattern) black cats or any other Halloween figure,
press them into the icing on the sides of the cake.</p>

<h2>Saut&eacute;ing and Frying</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 145px;">
<img src="images/fig7b.jpg" width="145" height="199" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>"What is the difference between saut&eacute;ing potatoes and frying them?" asks
a young housekeeper from South Dakota in the Day's Work, and as the
subject is of much importance and deserving of more space than may be
given to it in the correspondence columns it is answered here.</p>

<p>In a word, to saut&eacute;&mdash;pronounced sotay&mdash;anything, is to cook it in a
shallow frying pan with a little fat, turning as one side is browned to
let the other color. Cooked potatoes are often warmed over this way. To
"fry" potatoes, croquettes, etc., is to cook them in deep boiling fat,
immersing the object to be fried while the fat is boiling hot.</p>

<p>That is the difference between saut&eacute;ing and frying but there are one or
two points about frying&mdash;this much abused way of cooking&mdash;that must be
borne in mind if one would have the best results. In frying, a deep
kettle must be used and it is wise to keep one for this purpose only.
The one called a Scotch bowl is especially made for this purpose and is
most satisfactory.</p>

<p>Use only the best fat for frying&mdash;an absolutely pure leaf lard which
contains neither water nor salt and have your kettle two thirds full,
that is, deep enough to quite cover the article to be fried. Once
started, this quantity must be kept up, as it reduces slightly with each
frying, but the same fat may be used again and again if care be taken to
keep it clean and of a good color. After each frying let the fat cool a
little and strain to remove crumbs, etc., which would otherwise burn and
spoil the fat. If strained when very hot it is apt to unsolder the
strainer. Wipe the kettle clean, return the strained lard and set aside
until wanted again.</p>

<p><b>French Fried Potatoes</b> are sliced thin or cut lengthwise in strips laid
in ice water for half an hour; then dried thoroughly between two towels
and plunged into boiling deep fat. As soon as they are delicately
browned they are fished out with a split spoon and laid in a hot
colander to drain off every drop of fat. Serve at once.</p>

<p><b>German Fried Potatoes</b> are as a rule cooked and cold before they are
saut&eacute;ed. Some prefer them to the French. To many minds they never get
quite rid of the stale taste that clings to the cold potato. The same
may be said of stewed cold, cooked potatoes. The least objectionable way
of serving them as left-overs is to saut&eacute; them.</p>

<p>"<i>To have bread excite thankfulness, and a drink of water send the heart
to God, is better than sighs for the unattainable. To plough a straight
furrow on Monday, or dust a room well on Tuesday, or kiss a bumped
forehead on Wednesday, is worth more than the most ecstatic thrill under
Sunday eloquence. Spirituality is seeing God in common things and
showing God in common tasks.</i>"&mdash;MALTBIE D. BACOCK.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>The School Child's Sleep</h2>


<p>The mother who has a child at school may not be able to help him with
his lessons, but there is one thing she can do for him which will
benefit him even more, and that is to see that he gets enough sleep.</p>

<p>Insufficient sleep affects the nerves, the temper, the digestion, the
mental quickness, and even the morals of children. The child who gets
enough sleep is the one who is bright and quick mentally, who grows
normally and well, who eats properly and who is not peevish and
irritable.</p>

<p>An early supper and an early bedtime are the things for the school
child. Then put him in a well-ventilated bedroom and let him have ten or
eleven full hours of slumber and he'll wake up bright and healthy and
good, too.</p>

<p>Many of the little whining nervous children we see are simply suffering
from lack of sleep. Many small naughtinesses simply come from tired
nerves and weariness of mind and body. So many mothers notice such a
difference in the behavior of children once they have started to school
and are at a loss to understand the reason. It is because the daily nap
which the child took before he went to school has been given up, but the
bedtime hour has not been changed. Consequently the nerves of the child
suffer.</p>

<p>Try giving the school child supper at half past five, a nourishing and
easily digested supper, too. Then at eight, promptly pack him off to
bed. If he doesn't sleep let him sip a cup of hot milk, and sit beside
him until he drowses off. Sleep is largely a habit and will be easily
acquired in a few evenings. And oh, the difference it will make to the
child in every way.&mdash;<i>Exchange.</i></p>

<h3>Hints on Picture Hanging</h3>

<p>Hang the pictures from the ceiling or picture rail by means of a thin
cord as nearly as possible the color of the walls. When this is done you
may, if you like, fill up the spaces left above the smaller pictures by
placing therein a miniature, or an old blue plate, or a little plaster
relief. This arrangement gives all the space, above or below, upon which
to rest your eyes, and is infinitely preferable to the usual way of
hanging pictures one over the other or all up and down the walls.
Fishing line makes an excellent substitute for picture wire and is much
less conspicuous.</p>

<h3>Saving Steps in the Kitchen</h3>


<p>The kitchen should be characterized by cleanliness, system and order.
Two maxims that will help save steps are: "A place for everything, and
everything in its place;" and "Plan your work, then work your plan."</p>

<p>1. Arrange kitchen as conveniently and systematically as possible. Walls
and floors should be easily cleaned. No superfluous furnishings or
worn-out utensils should be tolerated. Arrange stove, sink, shelves,
table or kitchen cabinet near together and in logical order, so that in
preparing a dish one can move from raw material at table or cabinet
around to the washed dish at sink. Have shelves and hooks within easy
reach. Have drain-board and shelves for dishes convenient to sink. Keep
stove lifters and cloths for managing hot dishes upon hooks near stove.
Arrange those utensils and raw materials in constant use close at hand,
placing utensils used in same kind of work together. In storeroom and
pantry arrange shelves in certain order, with things seldom used on
highest shelves and those used oftener on lower shelves. Place together
ingredients used for salad-making, as vinegar, mustard, etc.; things
used in laundry together, etc. Other groups will suggest themselves.
Keep all groceries possible in air-tight labelled cans or glass jars.</p>

<p>2. Stock your kitchen with as many labor-saving devices as you can
afford, making sure they are suited to your needs. Keep all utensils and
tools in good repair. Glass oven-doors, small tables upon rollers which
can be wheeled into dining room, indexed cook books and clipping-files
are step-savers.</p>

<p>3. Plan each day's work ahead and have materials and utensils for that
day's work handy.</p>

<p>4. Do all kitchen work in a certain order, using that routine which
experience has proved best.</p>

<p>5. Think before you step. When in storeroom or pantry bring as many
needed articles as possible at one time. Baskets and waiters are great
helps here. In preparing a certain dish first gather together all
necessary ingredients and utensils. Do not begin work until everything
is ready. When possible prepare several things for the stove at once.</p>

<p>6. Clean and straighten as you go, replacing disarranged utensils, etc.
Have plenty of hot water handy, placing in soak those articles which
cannot be washed immediately. While preparing one meal do as much as
possible toward getting the next ready. If meals are planned ahead, many
things for supper can be cooked with the noon-day meal, also the
breakfast cereal. After each meal leave everything ship-shape for the
next.</p>

<h2>Supplying the Meat Flavor</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There are many meat dishes very nourishing and wholesome
which are total failures because of their lack of flavor.
This lack of flavor seriously impairs their value in
nutriment. A little Armour's Extract of Beef will in every
case provide that touch of flavor which appeals to the
palate and finds ready response from the digestive juices of
the stomach. This extract is very highly concentrated, so
that only a little is required.</p></div>


<h4>RICE SOUP</h4>

<p>Dissolve one teaspoon of Armour's Extract of Beef in one quart of water,
add one half cup of cooked rice, and a tablespoon of onion juice. Add
one teaspoon of celery seed and cover closely. Simmer ten minutes and

<h2>Home Dressmaking</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 144px;">
<img src="images/fig11b.jpg" width="144" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>
<p>This is an age of good ready made clothes and it is also an age of
clever amateur dressmaking. With excellent patterns which may be easily
handled there is no reason why the woman who can sew should not make her
own clothes, and have smart clothes at a reasonable price&mdash;that is,
provided she has the time to give to sewing.</p>

<p>Before starting a dress&mdash;even before buying&mdash;make a tour of the shops
and see for yourself what is being worn with a keen eye for the little
details which lift a gown from the home made to the professional class.
If you live far from town and can not go to the shops look through the
magazines which make a feature of dress and study what is best suited to
your particular style and requirements. Study materials and buy
economically, which means paying a little more if necessary rather than
have shoddy goods.</p>

<p>Good patterns are essential and these usually have full directions as to
the manner of using. It is a very good plan to have a pattern drafted to
your own measure but if you have not this take some finished garment
which is satisfactory (unless there is someone at hand to take the
measures that a person cannot very well take for herself) and measure
the lengths in different places such as front, back and under lengths on
a blouse and the width across both back and front where it is broadest.
Write these down and proceed to take the same measures on the pattern to
be used. In taking measures be sure to take a correct position or it
will be impossible to get correct measures and you cannot hope for
success if this&mdash;the initial step&mdash;is taken wrongly. For instance, stand
erect with the chest raised and the abdomen held in and you will find in
taking the width measures across to where the arms and body join the
armhole will be straight and even looking instead of pointing in and out
in places.</p>

<p>Make sure of your measures before starting to apply your pattern to the
cloth. A careful study of this will save many irreparable mistakes
later.</p>

<h2>Halloween</h2>


<p>The date of this oldtime celebration is always October 31st, the crucial
moment 12 o'clock. To be sure, the original observance of All Hallows
Eve has been considerably distorted during the course of years but the
fun it affords the young folks in its present manner of keeping cannot
be gainsaid and needs no changing. Halloween is the night when a magic
spell enthrals the earth. Witches, bogies, brownies and elves are all
abroad to use their power. Superstition proves true, witchery is
recognized and the future may be read in a hundred and one ways.</p>

<p>No occasion gives more opportunity of enjoyment and no party is gayer
than a Halloween party.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to spend a great deal of money in giving a Halloween
party. With a little time, some suitable paper and a pair of sharp
scissors the witches, pumpkin faces, cats and bats, which are the
distinctive features of this decoration, may be easily made at home.
Yellow, red and black are the colors and the most fascinating crepe
paper can be had for a few cents. This is the best material to use, as
it lends itself so well to all sorts of schemes.</p>

<p>Not only is it made in plain colors which may be decorated at will but
for every festival and occasion there are special designs which make the
work of decoration very easy indeed.</p>

<p>For Halloween there is a design of witches with brooms, or cats and bats
in black on a yellow ground. This is ready to be laid on the table as a
cover or around the room in the effect of a frieze. There are napkins to
match and a crepe paper rope to finish the edge.</p>

<p>A weird effect of lighting is obtained by making lantern boxes from any
discarded boxes which may be in the house. Cover them with crepe paper,
cut eyes, nose, ears and mouth, paste colored tissue paper behind the
features and set a lighted candle inside.</p>

<p>The wise owl must not be forgotten in the Halloween decorations. Grey
paper is best for him. Paste the edges of a square piece of grey crepe
paper together lengthwise of the grain and gather in at the bottom.
Stuff this bag with soft paper or cotton and gather again some distance
from the top. Shape the top into ears and make two rosettes with black
centers for eyes. A beak of black stiff paper protrudes between the
eyes. Mount the owl on a branch by sewing with heavy black thread in a
way to resemble claws.</p>

<p>Make witches' brooms by tying slashed paper tied on any old sticks or
brooms to give the effect.</p>

<h3>How to Clean It</h3>


<h4>Brass Ornaments</h4>

<p>Any brass which is exposed to the air is likely to tarnish very quickly.
To obviate this, after I have cleaned and polished my brass vases etc.,
in the usual way I take a rag, and with this smear just a tiny scrap of
vaseline over the brass. This keeps it bright and prevents it from
tarnishing.</p>


<h4>Wicker Tables or Chairs</h4>

<p>To take stains out of white wicker-work, I get some oxalic acid, and
with an old toothbrush dipped in this I brush the stained parts well.
Then I rinse the article thoroughly, first in clear, warm water, and
then in cold. The brush should be destroyed after use, as oxalic acid is
poisonous.</p>


<h4>To Wash Chiffon</h4>

<p>To wash chiffon, wind the material round a bottle. Make a good lather of
soap and water. Immerse the bottle, and move backwards and forwards in
the lather for about five minutes. Rinse in clear, lukewarm water in
which has been dissolved a small piece of gum arabic. Then unwind the
chiffon, spread on the ironing board, lay a clean, thin cloth over it,
and iron with a very hot iron.</p>


<h4>A Black Hat</h4>

<p>The very best way to clean a black hat, whether it be chip, mohair, or
tagel, real or imitation, is to make some rather strong tea, and, after
brushing all dust from the hat, apply this with a small brush. Saturate
the hat thoroughly, and when dry it will be as perfect in colour and
appearance as when first bought.</p>

<p>If you want the hat to be stiff, add half a teaspoonful of liquid gum to
the tea, and mix well before applying. The hat will then keep its
stiffness, but will not have a glossy appearance.</p>


<h4>Real Lace</h4>

<p>Real lace should never be washed, but can be cleaned in the following
way. Put it between layers of tissue paper well sprinkled with calcined
magnesia, place between the leaves of a book, and under a heavy weight
for three days. Then shake the powder out and the lace will be perfectly
clean.</p>

<h2>Small Pieces from the Whole Ham</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The economy of buying a whole ham at once instead of a pound
or a slice is apparent to every housewife who studies her
weekly bills. The initial cost is less&mdash;many trips to the
store are saved and the housewife has the chance of using
all of the ham&mdash;trimmings, skin, bone, etc., etc.</p></div>

milk. When slightly thickened add the ham and the whites of two
hard-boiled eggs which have been mashed with fork. Season with salt,
pepper, and pour over round slices of toast which have been placed on
hot platter. Grate the yolks of eggs and sprinkle over the top. Garnish
with parsley.&mdash;<span class="smcap">MRS. G. F. JONES, 79 Washington St., Portland, Maine.</span></p>

<h2>Little Stories by Our Readers</h2>


<h3>A Ham Story</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img src="images/fig18a.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As we are lovers of good ham we always use Armour's Star Brand. I
generally buy the ham on Saturday as it keeps better than fresh meat. I
buy a whole ham (try to get one about ten pounds), then get the dealer
to cut two nice slices thick enough to broil, a little beyond the
center, leaving two nice ends, the string end the smaller. One slice I
use for Sunday morning Breakfast, the other one I wrap in a moist cloth,
place between two plates. This will keep three or four days.</p>

<p>I now take the large end, put it on in cold water, let simmer for a
couple of hours, then take out and drain; cut off skin, and part of the
fat and put it in the oven to finish cooking. The skin I save for use on
the griddle, the fat I render and use the dripping for salads. After
baking, serve hot or cold, sliced; I still have a small end and one
slice left, the small end I boil until thoroughly done, take out and use
the water for vegetables, such as cabbage, spinach, beans, etc. The
small end does not slice as well as the other so I take all the meat
from the bone, and put it through the chopper, grind it fine, and use it
for ham loaf, toast filling for tomato cups or for ham omelet. The baked
end I serve sliced, also, use for sandwiches. If I have to keep the
sandwiches I put them in a moistened napkin; it keeps the ham moist and
juicy.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h3>How I Arrange to Use a Whole Ham</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Breakfast</span>: Water cress, slice Star Ham broiled with milk gravy,
hot rolls, coffee, home-made peach cake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Dinner</span>: Beef pot roast, white potatoes whipped, sweet potatoes
roasted under the meat, cauliflower boiled in the ham water, cream
dressing, fruit sherbet, in which I use Armour's Grape Juice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Supper</span>: Cold baked Star Ham sliced thin, or tomato cups on
lettuce with mustard dressing, white bread and butter, home-made cake,
sliced peaches, and tea.</p>

<p>To make <span class="smcap">Tomato Cups</span>, take medium size tomatoes, skin them (by pouring
boiling water over them first, this is easily done) and put on ice until
cold; scoop out the center. Make a filling of minced ham, a little
chicken, breadcrumbs (equal parts), a seasoning of chopped peppers; fill
tomatoes; on top of each put a little mustard dressing. Set each cup on
a lettuce leaf, and serve.</p>

<p>Now I still have one slice of ham left, some minced ham, some of the
baked ham. The last slice I broil and serve with poached eggs; the baked
ham, makes sandwiches. The week I buy a whole ham I don't buy much other
meat. Trusting this will be of value to some, I remain,&mdash;I. M. B.,
Philadelphia.</p>

<h3>Milk Toast</h3>

<p>"Have kept Armour's Beef Extract always on hand for years and it has
helped me out of many a tight place. One day the children teased for
milk toast for supper, and to my dismay I found the milk was 'short'
that day. Not wishing to disappoint them I tried to see what I could do.
I made a consomm&eacute; with Armour's Beef Extract, using a quarter
teaspoonful to a cup and seasoning it with salt and pepper, and used
this in the same way as I would milk. Our 'milk' toast was fit for a
king. The children pronounced it the best ever. In these times of high
prices, with milk at ten cents per quart, many a family would welcome
such an excellent substitute as Armour's Extract."</p>

<p>Most useful are the Armour's Bouillon Cubes. I use them in preparing
soups, gravies, dissolved and poured over a roast while cooking. I give
my husband and children each one in a cup of hot water, every morning
for breakfast, the first thing, as it seems to be an appetizer; also
serve it to my aged parents in the morning before rising, as it gives
them strength to make their toilet. They are both very aged and failing
and the effect of the bouillon is wonderful. My husband also takes
Armour's Bouillon Cubes with him in his lunch basket to the factory
where he holds a clerical position; he keeps his bouillon cup and spoon
and there is plenty of boiling water accessible, so it makes a nice,
nourishing drink at lunch time.&mdash;Mrs. E. B., Greensburg, Pa.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<h3>A Red Letter for Armour's Extract</h3>

<p>We have a friend who derived more benefit (in our estimation) from
Armour's Extract, than any one we have ever heard of. He is an expert
machinist and is sent to all parts of the world to put up machines, such
as reapers, mowers, etc. The particular trip I write of he was sent to
Bulgaria, to a small village, where the accommodations were very poor.
Sleep was almost out of the question and to eat the black bread, which
was the principal food, was impossible. The water in all foreign
countries was so bad that he always carried jars of the Extract with
him. This time he not only dissolved it in hot water and drank it, but
took his penknife and fed himself the extract raw. He claims it saved
his life, as for four days that was all he had with him to eat or drink.
He says he felt fine and did his work better than when he had been where
the food was palatable and he had eaten heartily. Of course he swears by
the Extract and never takes a trip now without taking a good supply with
him.&mdash;Mrs. H. L., Yorktown Heights, Westchester Co., N. Y.</p>

<h2>Making Money for the Church</h2>


<p>"Besides selling recipes for eggless, butterless cake, we made seasoning
bags to sell, for soups and such, using eight peppercorns, four cloves,
six mustard seeds, one third teaspoon celery seed, four tiny sprigs each
of thyme, summer savory, sweet basil, and parsley in each. This gives a
blend pleasant to many tastes, and it is sufficient to flavor a soup for
a large family. When the soup seems to have taken enough of the flavor
the bag should be removed. To make one bag at a time would be foolish,
but when enough are made to last the year out it helps out in fine
shape. We also made jelly bags for sale, many ladies not having the
right thickness of cloth in the house at jelly-making time."</p>

<p>"At Christmas time the young girls of our congregation made quite a few
dollars for the church by selling boxes of preserved orange. This is
their recipe: Cut six large navel oranges in slices the long way of the
fruit, and boil, until tender, in three waters, pouring off the water
each time. Make a syrup of five cups of sugar and one cup of water and
boil the orange in this until the syrup is almost boiled away. Remove
with skimmer and let stand half an hour and roll each piece in
granulated sugar. The confection was packed in dainty white boxes and
covered with paraffin paper. They found a very ready sale."&mdash;K. C. B.</p>

<p>"It has been our experience that everyday necessities in the household
are better sellers than fancy nicknacks," writes a reader, "and when the
social club of our church met last winter we decided to stick to them.
Here are some of the things we made with the result that when we held
our sale at Easter there was not one article left over and we had the
sum of ninety-five dollars in the treasury."</p>


<h4>Ice Bags</h4>

<p>"These bags, made out of ordinary potato sacking, are for covering the
cake of ice, and do much to keep down the ice bill. They are twenty-four
inches long by twenty-seven inches wide and have a drawstring of common
twine. They cost almost nothing and found ready sale at a quarter
apiece."</p>


<p>Wringing Bags</p>

<p>"This idea we got from a trained nurse who was with us for a time, and
it is a very good thing to have on hand when there is sickness. When hot
cloths are to be applied it is hard to wring them out by hand as hot as
the doctor would like. The bags are made of strong ticking and measure
eighteen inches in width and are ten inches deep. At each end a loop the
depth of the bag was stitched, through which a piece of broom handle was
run when in use. To use, put the flannel into the bag, and set the bag
into the pan of boiling water on the stove (first inserting the sticks).
When ready, simply lift the bag and wring it by the sticks."</p>


<h4>Carpenter's Aprons</h4>

<p>"There has been a good deal of building done in our small town and one
of our members, whose husband is a building contractor, offered to buy
half a dozen carpenter's aprons if we would make them. This order has
led to our making over two hundred of these aprons, as others hearing of
it would want their aprons home-made rather than factory made. They are
made of strong ticking, with a strap around the neck and another at the
waist. In some, the straps are around the shoulders instead of the neck.
Pockets are made for a rule, knife, nails, and a strap for a
hammer."&mdash;Mrs. T. G. H.</p>

<h2>Where Does Your Housekeeping Money Go?</h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Housekeeping money to many men means the actual money
required for food. Not very many husbands realize how many
little expenses the housekeeping money has to take care
of&mdash;little expenses that have nothing to do with food. Here
are some and the Editor will be very glad if the readers
will send in their own experiences in this line.</p></div>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 149px;">
<img src="images/fig20a.jpg" width="149" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Most men smoke, and most men like to pocket a nice fresh box of matches
when starting off for the day. Matches don't cost much to be sure but a
fresh box each morning cuts quite a hole in the housekeeping money which
is used to buy them.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Does your husband like to sit up late reading, playing chess, etc.? That
sort of thing increases the light and coal bill quite a bit.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The pennies given for charity, church collections, etc., are also
"extras."</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Returning little courtesies&mdash;very often to "his" people&mdash;such as sending
flowers, books, and occasional lunch or matinee, etc., etc., all make
quite a hole in the housekeeping money.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>The wear and tear of household utensils, linen, etc., means constant
replenishment of one thing or another. A man may realize that his buggy
or motor car has to have certain parts replaced once in a while but he
is not apt to think of the pots and pans of the household side of things
unless reminded.</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>It is a good plan to keep a few simple medicines at hand in case of
sudden sickness, also a few bandages and the usual dressings required
for accidents. Does your housekeeping money make provision for this?</p>

<hr style='width: 25%;' />

<p>Money for the education of the children is not generally included in the
housekeeping money, but when the children get old enough to want to have
their friends visit them it means little lunches, suppers,
entertainments of various kinds, all of which cuts into the housekeeping
money. As this is really the social side of their education it is only
fair that extra provision should be made for it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>Why Eat Fruit?</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/fig20b.jpg" width="153" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>It is a very good plan to find out the medicinal and curative properties
of the different fruits and to make the fruit your system requires a
part of your diet.</p>

<p>Apples, for instance, have an excellent effect on the health generally.
They contain a large proportion of water and a large quantity of potash
as well as of malic acid, which has valuable properties, and ether which
is beneficial to the liver. Plums, too, have certain virtues and lemons
are good for several forms of stomach trouble. As for grapes, they are
so valuable as to form a distinctive "cure" just in themselves. They
possess an enormous quantity of potash and plenty of water and they also
contain sugar and salts of tartar. That all means that grapes will do
much for the person who is tired and run down, whose nerves are weakened
and whose organs are overworked, that they will tone and regulate the
system, purify the blood and assist the different organs in performing
their functions. The presence of sugar indicates that they can provide
fuel for the body&mdash;the human engine&mdash;whether it be the romping child or
the man whose day is filled with hard physical labor. So it follows that
grapes are really a very valuable addition to our diet list.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not always possible to have grapes on our table but
wise manufacturers have found a way by which the juice of the grape may
be possible at all times of the year and in every corner of the land.
They have built large factories right in the very heart of the country
where the best grapes grow and there the grapes are taken while the dew
is still on them and their luscious fragrant deliciousness is squeezed
out, poured into bottles and quickly sealed to prevent any escape of the
exquisite bouquet.</p>

<p>Nothing is added&mdash;no water to weaken and adulterate, no sugar to
sweeten, no coloring essence to deceive the eye. It is just the pure,
natural juice of earth's best offering. This bottled concentration of
earth's sweetness and richness with all the life and warmth of the
sunshine is Armour's Grape Juice.</p>

<h2>Baked Beans&mdash;A National Dish</h2>


<p>To many people baked beans means just one thing&mdash;baked beans, served hot
or cold. To the woman, however, who is really interested in furnishing
variety in diet, and this in a very economical way, baked beans offers
boundless possibilities. First of all, she lays in a stock of Veribest
Baked Beans&mdash;Veribest, because she knows that in this particular brand
the beans are even more thoroughly cooked than she herself could do
them. There are two kinds of Veribest Baked Beans, plain, and with
tomato sauce, and with both the mellow richness of the bean is preserved
with all its natural flavor, making it a most toothsome dish as well as
nutritious and economical. Having a good stock to draw from the
economical housewife proceeds to serve baked beans to her family every
day for a week, varying the dish each day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For Monday</span> there is a New England Supper&mdash;baked beans with hot Boston
brown bread. Drop the can of baked beans into hot water and boil for 20
minutes. Turn out, garnish with parsley and serve with mustard pickles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tuesday, for lunch.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bean Croquettes.</span> Drain Veribest Pork and Beans
(without tomato sauce), and pass them through a colander. Measure and
allow one teaspoon of dry bread crumbs to each cup of beans. Season with
cayenne pepper and a little minced parsley. For a pint of the mixture,
beat one egg. Save enough of the egg to dip the croquettes in, and add
the remainder to the beans. Mix and form into small croquettes, or
balls, then roll in fine bread crumbs. Dip them in egg and again in the
crumbs, and fry in deep boiling Simon Pure Leaf Lard. Border with slices
of dill pickles or sweet green peppers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wednesday, School Lunches.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bean Sandwiches.</span> Cut some thin slices from a
loaf of brown bread, butter and put crisp lettuce leaves, with a
teaspoon of mayonnaise, on each half of the slices, and on the others
spread a layer of Armour's Veribest Pork and Beans, which have been
mashed until smooth. Put the slices together and wrap each sandwich
separately in paraffin paper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thursday.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bean Celery Salad.</span> Mix one can of Veribest Pork and Beans,
four tablespoons of celery cut in one eighth inch rings, two tablespoons
of finely chopped onions, and one fourth cup of good boiled dressing.
Marinate thoroughly, but stir slightly. Rub the salad dish with a cut
clove of garlic. Arrange lettuce leaves around the salad bowl and in the
center make a mound of the salad mixture, to which one fourth cup of
whipped cream has been added. Garnish with stuffed olives cut in rings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Friday.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Attractive Luncheon Dish.</span> Heat one can of Veribest Pork and
Beans (without tomato sauce), tossing about with fork to prevent
breaking or mashing the beans. Season to taste. Serve in beet shells
which have been previously prepared as follows: Wash the beets
carefully, so as not to break the skins, and boil rapidly until tender.
Then cover with cold water, and with the hands remove the skins. Scoop
out the centers and fill the cases with the beans. Garnish with young
celery leaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saturday.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Puree of Beans.</span> To one can of Armour's Veribest Beans and
Tomato Sauce add two cups of milk; boil for a few minutes and pass
through a sieve. Add salt and pepper to taste, a dash of sage, dry
mustard and more water if required. Strain over croutons in the tureen
and sprinkle with chopped parsley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sunday Night Supper.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bean Loaf.</span> Two cups of Veribest Pork and Beans,
mashed to a pulp, one fourth cup of chopped nuts, one cup of browned
bread crumbs, two teaspoons of grated onion, two eggs, one half cup of
cream or rich milk, one teaspoon of salt. Mix thoroughly and put into a
greased bread pan. Brush with the beaten yolk of egg, milk or cream and
bake one half hour. Serve with tomato sauce.</p>

<h2>Answers to Correspondents</h2>


<p><i>Please tell me the proper way to send wedding announcements. In a
family where there are several young men and women do I send each a
separate one?</i></p>

<p>If economy is no object send each a separate card. If you do not care to
do this and they are brothers and sisters you may say "The Misses Brown"
and "The Messrs. James and John Wilson."</p>

<p><i>I would like very much to be able to help other housekeepers, but I
always feel that I only know the simple things of my rather humdrum life
in the country.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. D., Ohio</span>.</p>

<p>What you know is not known to everyone, nor is what any housekeeper
knows a matter of everyday use with other housekeepers. Everyone has
some short cut or recipe, or personal way of doing things that would
lighten the way for others. Your recommendation of butterine for
instance, would carry weight with some housekeepers who had never before
thought of trying it and they would be grateful always for being shown
how to cut their butter bill. So with the other suggestions in your good
letter from which I have taken extracts for the other pages. I want just
such letters as yours. We must not forget that the younger generation of
housekeepers are starting housekeeping and scanning columns like these
for "the things everyone knows."</p>

<p><i>Yellow and white scheme for coming-out party.</i>&mdash;H. M. B.</p>

<p>Many thanks for the nice things you say about the Cook Book. Am very
glad you have enjoyed it so long. The color scheme you mention could be
carried out further by wearing white dresses with yellow sashes and hair
ribbons. Have yellow ices and cakes with white and yellow frosting. Egg
sandwiches, potato salad garnished with hard boiled eggs halved and
yellow flowers, which are quite plentiful now would all help to carry
out the idea.</p>

<p><i>What is the seventh anniversary of a wedding called? and is the
celebration of these anniversaries out of style?</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. G. T., Boise City.</span></p>

<p>It is perfectly proper to celebrate and you can have a merry time with
little expense. Have tiny woolly toy sheep for favors and serve lamb
salad (made after a chicken salad recipe). Wear a woolen dress and your
husband white flannels.</p>

<p><i>I belong to a little card club and have to entertain the other members
one afternoon soon. Can you suggest something which is easily prepared
and can be served as a lap lunch?</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. F. T., Huntington, W. Va.</span></p>

<p>Ham mousse in individual moulds with thin bread and butter sandwiches.
Ice cream served in cantaloupe. Iced tea with a slice of lemon and
Armour's Grape Juice, which needs no flavoring.</p>

<p><i>What can I put with my silverware when packing it away to keep it from
tarnishing?</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span></p>

<p>Pack in bags of Canton flannel before putting into the drawers or boxes
and place with them a few pieces of camphor gum.</p>

<p><i>Please tell me if it is proper to eat cake with the fingers or must a
fork be used?</i></p>

<p>It depends on the cake. If one with a soft filling, a fork will be
necessary.</p>


<h3>Requested Recipes</h3>


<h5><span class="smcap">For G. H.</span></h5>

<h4>Molasses Custard</h4>

<p>Take one cup molasses (ribbon cane is the best; I have never tried corn
syrup), add one half cup sugar, stir well and put on fire to boil for at
least five minutes. Let cool for a short time, than add three
well-beaten eggs, stirring constantly to keep the eggs from curdling.
Add a tablespoonful of cornstarch. Bake in pie crust in the regular way
but slowly. To keep from browning too quickly I sometimes place a tin in
oven over pie.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Mrs. F. A. F., Jacksonville, Texas.</p>


<h5><span class="smcap">For Mrs. T. H., Oswego, N. Y.</span></h5>

<h4>Boiled Bacon</h4>

<p>Place the bacon in a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it.
Bring the water to the simmering point and simmer gently until done
(time, about half an hour for a pound for large pieces, less for
smaller). Add to the water an onion with two or three cloves stuck in
it, one carrot, one turnip and some sticks of celery. Skim carefully
several times. When done, remove the skin and cover with browned bread
crumbs.</p>


<h3>Found Out!</h3>

<p>When making shells for custard and lemon pies prick the crust all over
with a fork before baking. Bake the shells over an inverted pie plate,
then place them in pie plate as usual before filling.&mdash;Mrs. D. H.,
Media, Pa.</p>

<p>If a cake gets scorched on top when baking, grate lightly with a nutmeg
grater rather than try to scrape it with a knife. You will have a better
surface for frosting.&mdash;C. K., Hurley, Texas.</p>

<p>When your tablecloths begin to wear out make napkins out of the best
parts and get a new tablecloth.</p>

<p>Save your old newspapers and when you sweep soak the papers in water in
which a tablespoonful of ammonia has been dissolved. Squeeze out and
throw the paper pulp on the floor you are about to sweep. It will keep
the dust from flying and at the same time brighten the carpets.</p>

<p>Save all soap scraps and put them into an empty baking powder can that
you have turned into a soap shaker by the help of a hammer and nail.
Punch eight or ten small holes in the top and bottom, run a piece of
wire from lid to bottom to hang it up by. When washing dishes shake the
box in the water and you will have a nice suds.</p>

<p>Do not throw away the small pieces of paraffin that you take from the
tops of jelly glasses. They can be melted and used again. If you do not
make jelly, use them to mix with the kindling. They start a fire like
coal oil. Ends of candles may be used in the same way. If the wick in
the lamp is short and you are out of coal oil, fill the lamp with water.
The oil will rise to the top and the wick will burn as long as there is
oil to burn.</p>

<p>Put a tablespoonful of salt in your lamp and the blaze will be twice as
bright.&mdash;C. L. E., Dayton.</p>

<p>A damp or slightly oily cloth is all that is necessary to polish oak
furniture if it is in good condition. Marks made by wet glasses should
be rubbed with a mixture of nine parts olive oil and one part
paraffin.&mdash;Mrs. W., Stilesboro, Ga.</p>

<p>A very simple, attractive and inexpensive gift may be made by crocheting
a simple edge for bath towels of the silk finished crochet cotton, and
working the monogram or initial in cross stitch, using the same thread.
The washrag should have a tiny edge to match.&mdash;Mrs. J. H. M., New
Mexico.</p>

<p>My linen dress had a tear and as it was bought ready made there were no
left over pieces. I drew a few threads from the under hem and darned it
with these and when laundered it could scarcely be seen.&mdash;Mrs. J. E. F.</p>

<h2>Hints for October</h2>


<div class="sidenote">A Hot Drink with the School Lunch</div>

<p>Whether the individual drinking cup is a requirement in all public
schools, or not, its use is a habit which should be encouraged. A
collapsible cup takes up little room in the lunch basket. With it place
one of the Armour Bouillon Cubes. At lunch time this cube dropped into a
cup of hot water provides a drink of bouillon that is refreshing,
stimulating and healthful.</p>

<p>Armour's Bouillon Cubes, chicken and beef flavor, are sold in tins of
12, 50 and 100&mdash;each cube wrapped separately in tin foil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fruit Out of Season</div>

<p>The tonic value of pure fruit juices makes them desirable all the year
around, and the caloric properties of grape juice place it at the head
of the list. Just now the Armour factories, in the heart of the
grape-growing sections of New York and Michigan, have their presses at
work extracting the pure juice from the season's luscious Concords. This
juice, undiluted, unfermented and unsweetened, is immediately bottled,
retaining all the delicious fragrance and flavor of the grape.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>For household use there are cases of bottles in quarter-pint
sizes and larger. Armour's Grape Juice is a splendid flavor
for desserts and ices.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Government Inspection</div>

<p>Housewives realize, more than ever before, their responsibility in
selecting for their families foods that are wholesome and healthful. One
of the strictest Government inspections is on butterine. In using
Glendale Butterine there is a saving of fully one third over the cost of
butter, and there is no question about its cleanliness, purity and
wholesomeness.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Armour's Glendale Butterine is carefully wrapped and sold in
paraffined cartons.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">The Family Cupboard</div>

<p>Anyone in the family can serve on short notice a meal that is sure to
please,&mdash;<i>if</i> the cupboard is well stocked from the extensive variety of
Veribest Soups, Meats and Food Specialties. All are as thoroughly cooked
and seasoned as in the home kitchen, and it's a simple matter to heat
the contents of the cans and serve.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Best grocers in all parts of the country sell Veribest
goods.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">A Simple Lesson in Soup Making</div>

<p>The usual process of simmering meats and vegetables is so tedious and
troublesome that frequently soup is omitted from the bill of fare when
there is good reason for its presence. It is especially beneficial in
preparing the way for the easy digestion of heavier foods. Veribest
Soups are scientifically cooked and seasoned. For use, heat the soup and
dilute it to the preferred consistency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Choice of the Many</div>

<p>It is the greatest satisfaction to know of one breakfast dish that is
always welcomed by guests. Whether they come from North or South, they
relish sweet, crisp bacon. Armour's Star Bacon is a mild sugar cure,
hickory smoked, and is most delicate.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Star Bacon is sold in glass jars and paper cartons.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Keeping Household Accounts</div>

<p>Buying ham by the single slice is necessarily much more expensive than
buying a whole ham, for there is the cost of cutting besides the waste
by this method. After slices are cut from the whole ham, considerable
meat will be left on the bone. These bits can be used in many ways, and
the bone can be boiled with vegetables or for soup.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Armour's Star Ham is cured and smoked by special process
which has given it the famous flavor.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Little But Efficient</div>

<p>No product is better known or more highly appreciated than the little
jars of Armour's Extract of Beef. This Extract has many uses, and a
little goes far in making soup stock, beef tea, flavoring the cheaper
cuts of meat, gravies and vegetables.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Most druggists and grocers can supply Armour's Extract of
Beef in two sizes of jars.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">Women Who Succeed</div>

<p>To have light, flakey pastry, doughnuts that are neither heavy nor
grease-soaked, and fried dishes that are just right, our successful
cooks have found that the first essential is good, old-fashioned pure
leaf lard, tried out in open kettles, just as our grandmothers made it.
Such is Armour's Simon Pure Leaf Lard, which is sold only in pails. Best
dealers can supply it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Luncheon Innovation</div>

<p>A piquant meat filling for sandwiches&mdash;one that is already prepared and
requires only careful slicing&mdash;is Armour's Summer Sausage. Each of the
several kinds is a careful blending of meats and seasoning. Packed in
casing, they will keep indefinitely and therefore it is possible to have
a supply at hand ready for any emergency.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
